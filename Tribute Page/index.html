            <b>William Henry Gates III</b> (born October 28, 1955) is an American business magnate, software developer,
            investor, author, and philanthropist. He is a co-founder of Microsoft, along with his late childhood friend
            Paul Allen. During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, chief executive
            officer (CEO), president and chief software architect, while also being the largest individual shareholder
            until May 2014. He was a major entrepreneur of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s.

            <br>
            Gates was born and raised in Seattle, Washington. In 1975, he and Allen founded Microsoft in Albuquerque,
            New Mexico. It became the world's largest personal computer software company. Gates led the company as
            chairman and CEO until stepping down as CEO in January 2000, succeeded by Steve Ballmer, but he remained
            chairman of the board of directors and became chief software architect. During the late 1990s, he was
            criticized for his business tactics, which have been considered anti-competitive. In March 2020, Gates left
            his board positions at Microsoft and Berkshire Hathaway to focus on his philanthropic efforts on climate
            change, global health and development, and education.
            <br>
            <br>
            Since 1987, Gates has been included in the Forbes list of the world's wealthiest people. From 1995
            to 2017, he held the Forbes title of the richest person in the world every year except from 2010 to
            2013. In October 2017, he was surpassed by Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, who had an estimated net
            worth of US$90.6 billion compared to Gates's net worth of US$89.9 billion at the time. As of October
            2022, Gates had an estimated net worth of US$107 billion, making him the fifth-richest person in the
            world.
            <br>
            <br>
            He has given sizable amounts of money to various charitable organizations and scientific research programs
            through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, reported to be the world's largest private charity. Through the
            foundation, he led an early 21st century vaccination campaign that significantly contributed to the
            eradication of the wild poliovirus in Africa. In 2010, Gates and Warren Buffett founded The Giving Pledge,
            whereby they and other billionaires pledge to give at least half of their wealth to philanthropy.
